## What is FIT-Checker for iOS
_**FIT-Checker** for iOS is a simple app which helps you to stay up to date
with your latest classification._

## tl; dr Quick setup
* Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/jakub-tucek/fit-checker`
* Install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency manager
* Install [SwiftGen](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen) for automated code generation
* Download and build dependencies: `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --no-use-binaries`
* Build the project with XCode: <kbd>cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>
* :tada: Have fun! :tada:

## Installation
Ok, quick setup is not that descriptive, lets make a tear down.

First things first,
clone the repo from Github:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jakub-tucek/fit-checker
```

Once the repository is cloned, you have to install dependencies. We use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) instead of CocoaPods
as dependency manager. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)
and install latest stable version of Carthage.

Because we believe that Swift and its ecosystem should be strongly typed and
code validity should be checked at build time, we use [SwiftGen](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen) to generate boilerplate code.
For now, SwiftGen automatically generates Enums with text translations. Check
[this guide](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen#installation) for SwiftGen
installation walkthrough.

Now the dependencies itself. Nothing fancy, run:

```bash
$ carthage bootstrap --platform iOS
```

**If you see any build errors after installation** caused by incompatible Swift version,
run `update` command on corrupted library with `--no-use-binaries` option. We are now
experiencing some issues with KeychainAccess binary, so after the `bootstrap` finishes,
we use:

```bash
$ carthage update KeychainAccess --no-use-binaries --platform iOS
```

Now you should be ready to run the app without any problem. If the app cannot be build,
please create a new issue if it's not already created.

## Help needed!
While we are busy maintaining current features and adding new, the UI and UX
are kinda neglected. We are looking for someone who can help us with some
design improvements. Feel free to contact us or create an issue!
